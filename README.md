# Advent of Code 2021

Solutions of the problems in AoC2021, using `Python`. Trying to focus on:
* high-performance solutions
* pure functions


## Running Requirements


Please create a new virtual environment with Python 3.7. For specific package requirements, check setup.cfg (running pip install -e . from the repo root folder should install all needed requirements).

## Structure

The input data is available in the `data` folder, as `data_DD_P`, where `DD` is the day of the problem and `P` is the index of the problem (`1` or `2`).
The scripts to run the data are available in the `bin` folder.
